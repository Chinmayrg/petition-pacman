#SAVE GOSTS FROM PACMAN
Every morning in a vintage game, a Ghost wakes up. It knows it must run faster than Pacman or it will be killed. Since years, this yellow character addicted to digital pills haunts the dreams of poor Ghosts (funny...). Help us so that this can stop.

###Project made during SPICED Academy 2019
